Let's make some Books show up in the Browser

1  Create a Book class -- which in Django is a Model
      1a Add it to the __init__.py
2  Create a new migration -- instrux for building table in the db
3  Migrate -- tell Django to build the Book table
3a  Put some book data in the db -- Do with a cool tool called a fixture!
4  Create a URL configuration for it in urls.py -- set up a pattern matching for which request handler ( view function ) to call when the request is for /books
5  Create a view for listing books -- this will fetch the book data from db, bind it to a template and send the HTML in a response to the browser
6  Create a template for a list of books
